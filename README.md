# S67_E_Library

**Project Title:** 

The Ultimate E-Library of Totally Useless Knowledge


**Project Overview:**
This project will create a quirky and fun e-library where users can explore and contribute to an ever-expanding collection of the most absurd, silly, and completely useless knowledge. The goal is to allow users to browse, add, update, and delete entries of obscure facts, like "the average lifespan of a sock," or "most commonly forgotten items left in a car," all while demonstrating various core web development concepts.

**Key Features:**

*User Accounts:* Users can sign up, log in, and create personal profiles to track the knowledge they've contributed.

*Library of Absurd Knowledge:* A dynamic list of entries (facts) that can be viewed by all users, each with a title, description, and a silly category (e.g., “Weird Food Facts,” “History of Left-Handedness,” etc.).

*Custom Lists:* Each user will have their own unique list of favorite or most ridiculous knowledge entries.

*Search & Sort:* A basic search function to find entries based on keywords or categories (e.g., “vegetable facts” or “weird sports”).

*Public and Private Mode:* Users can choose whether their facts are public for all to see, or just for their eyes only.


**Tech Stack:**

*Frontend:*

React (with Vite for faster development)
Tailwind CSS (for easy and quick styling)

*Backend:*

Express.js (Node.js)
MongoDB with Mongoose (for storing the user and knowledge data)
API development (for handling CRUD operations on the facts)

*Deployment:*

Heroku or Vercel (for hosting the front end)
MongoDB Atlas (for database hosting)

*Version Control:*

GitHub (for managing and tracking the project development)

**Why This Project:**

This project offers a fun, non-traditional way to learn web development. You'll build an API, connect it to a MongoDB database, and create a React front-end, all while working on an engaging project. By the end, you'll gain hands-on experience with user authentication, CRUD operations, and API deployment, all in an open-source GitHub environment.
